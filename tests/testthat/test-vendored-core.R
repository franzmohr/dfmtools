# The claims src/core/ and inst/COPYRIGHTS make about each other.
#
# tools/update-bayests-core.R checks both when it runs, and refuses to finish
# if either is broken -- but it needs an upstream BayesTS checkout, which no
# check machine has, so between refreshes nothing verified them. Everything
# below is answerable from the vendored tree alone, which is why it can live
# here.
#
# What is *not* here is the Armadillo redirection that makes the samplers draw
# from R's generator: src/bayests_rng_guard.cpp asserts that at compile time,
# on the configuration that was actually built, which is a stronger statement
# than reading the headers. The grep below is the weaker second question --
# whether any vendored file still asks for <armadillo> by name.

# Where the sources are, from wherever the tests were started.
#
# devtools::test() runs from tests/testthat inside the checkout; R CMD check
# runs from <pkg>.Rcheck/tests/testthat, with the unpacked tarball beside it as
# <pkg>.Rcheck/dfmtools. Both have to be found, or this skips in exactly the
# run it exists for. The installed package is not a candidate: src/core is not
# installed, only compiled.
