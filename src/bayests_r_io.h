// Translation between the R model object and the structs the vendored BayesTS
// core takes. This is the R counterpart of that project's src/io/hdf5/ layer:
// the only place that knows both an `Rcpp::List` and a `bayests::` struct, so
// that the sampler knows neither.
//
// One convention is worth stating once, because getting it wrong is silent
// rather than loud: draws run along the columns inside the core and along the
// rows in R, so everything crossing this boundary goes through draws_to_r() or
// read_draws_if_present().
//
// This is a trimmed copy of the same header in bvartools. What is missing is
// what only a VAR or a VEC needs -- read_spec(), the cointegration space
// priors, the variable selection reader. A dynamic factor model's own reader
// lives next to its binding in DfmNormalGamma.cpp, because its model list names
// its dimensions differently from every other model in that family and the
// translation is not shared with anything.
