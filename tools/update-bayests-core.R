## Refresh the vendored BayesTS core.
##
##   Rscript tools/update-bayests-core.R [path/to/BayesTS]
##
## Copies the part of the core this package needs into the two places it lives
## here and reapplies the one local patch: <armadillo> becomes "bayests/arma.h",
## so that RcppArmadillo is seen first and the sampler draws from R's RNG.
## Everything this script knows is written up in src/core/VENDORED.md; if you
## change one, change the other.
##
## Unlike bvartools, which mirrors the whole core, this package takes only what
## DfmNormalGamma reaches -- it is the one sampler here, and compiling the other
## thirteen would be a minute of build time and a larger shared object for code
## that is never called. The set is *computed* rather than listed: the script
## starts from the entry points below and follows every #include of a
## "bayests/..." or "core/..." header until nothing new turns up, taking each
## header's .cpp alongside it. A list would go stale the first time upstream
## added an include; this cannot.
